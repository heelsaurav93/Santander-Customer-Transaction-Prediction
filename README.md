# Santander-Customer-Transaction-Prediction

The mission at Santander has always been to help people and businesses prosper. Their goal has been to help customers understand their financial health and identify which products and services might help them achieve their monetary goals. The data science team at Santander has always been trying to find out a solution for one of their most common challenges, namely binary classification problems such as: is a customer satisfied? Will a customer buy this product? Can a customer pay this loan?

The goal of this challenge is to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted.
